# Roommate-Finder and Managment System
## Project Overview

Home Harmony is a web application designed to help bachelors find suitable rooms and compatible roommates based on their specific preferences and lifestyles.

Beyond just finding a place to live, the application functions as a complete Roommate Management System. It enables users living under the same roof to efficiently manage shared responsibilities, including daily expenses, utility bills, and household chores.

## Rationale
In densely populated cities like Dhaka, bachelors often face significant challenges in finding accommodations that match their needs or roommates who share similar habits.


- The Gap: There is a lack of platforms dedicated to both finding rooms and managing the day-to-day friction of shared living.


- The Solution: Home Harmony addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform for room listings, compatibility checking, and household management.
